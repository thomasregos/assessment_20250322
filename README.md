**TLDR: Probability prediction for a home assessment.**

# Notes
- The code is not modular as the assessment required a notebook containing all the relevant script
- The main emphasis is on dealing with inbalanced data using **non-supervised learning** and creating a **model to predict probabilities**
- It contains extensive **feature engineering**, but without proper feature selection
